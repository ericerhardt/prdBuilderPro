# üî¥ CRITICAL: RLS Infinite Recursion Fix

## The Error You're Seeing

```
[Checkout] Error fetching workspace: {
  code: '42P17',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "workspace_members"'
}
```

## Root Cause

Your `workspace_members` table had an RLS policy that **queries itself**, creating infinite recursion:

```sql
-- ‚ùå BROKEN - Creates infinite loop
CREATE POLICY "Users can view members of their workspaces" ON workspace_members
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM workspace_members wm  -- ‚Üê Queries itself!
      WHERE wm.workspace_id = workspace_members.workspace_id
      AND wm.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Why this creates infinite recursion:**
1. Checkout tries to query `workspace_members` table
2. RLS policy activates and checks the USING clause
3. USING clause queries `workspace_members` table again
4. This triggers the RLS policy again (step 2)
5. Infinite loop ‚Üí PostgreSQL detects and blocks it

## The Fix

### Solution: Security Definer Function

Create a helper function that **bypasses RLS** (marked as `SECURITY DEFINER`):

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Helper function bypasses RLS
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_workspace_ids(check_user_id UUID)
RETURNS SETOF UUID AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT workspace_id
  FROM workspace_members
  WHERE user_id = check_user_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- ‚úÖ Updated policy uses helper function (no recursion)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view members of their workspaces" ON workspace_members;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view members of their workspaces" ON workspace_members
  FOR SELECT USING (
    workspace_id IN (SELECT get_user_workspace_ids(auth.uid()))
  );
```

**Why this works:**
- The `SECURITY DEFINER` function runs with elevated privileges (bypassing RLS)
- When the policy calls this function, it doesn't trigger RLS policies again
- No recursion, no infinite loop!

## üöÄ Apply the Complete Fix

Run the comprehensive fix script that addresses **BOTH issues**:
1. ‚úÖ Infinite recursion in `workspace_members`
2. ‚úÖ Missing INSERT/UPDATE policies for billing tables

### Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql

2. **Copy and run**: `scripts/fix-rls-complete.sql`

3. **Verify** the output shows:
   - ‚úÖ Helper function created
   - ‚úÖ workspace_members policy recreated
   - ‚úÖ billing_customers INSERT/UPDATE policies added
   - ‚úÖ subscriptions INSERT/UPDATE policies added

## What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
1. ‚ùå Checkout tries to query workspace ‚Üí infinite recursion error
2. ‚ùå Can't create billing customer record ‚Üí missing INSERT policy
3. ‚ùå Can't save subscription ‚Üí missing INSERT policy
4. ‚ùå Checkout fails completely

### After (Fixed):
1. ‚úÖ Checkout queries workspace successfully (no recursion)
2. ‚úÖ Creates billing customer record (INSERT policy allows it)
3. ‚úÖ Webhook saves subscription (INSERT policy allows it)
4. ‚úÖ Subscription appears on billing page

## üß™ Test After Applying

1. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test checkout**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/pricing
   - Click "Subscribe" on any plan
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

3. **Check terminal logs** - Should see:
   ```
   [Checkout] Creating checkout session for user: xxx
   [Checkout] No billing customer found, creating new Stripe customer
   [Checkout] Stripe customer created: cus_xxx
   [Checkout] User workspace found: xxx-xxx-xxx
   [Checkout] Billing customer record created: { ... }
   ```

4. **Verify subscription appears** on `/billing` page

5. **No more errors!** ‚ú®

## üìã Verification Queries

After running the fix, verify everything is set up correctly:

### 1. Check helper function exists:
```sql
SELECT routine_name, security_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'get_user_workspace_ids';
```

Expected: `DEFINER` (means it bypasses RLS)

### 2. Check workspace_members policy:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, pg_get_expr(qual, 'workspace_members'::regclass) as using_clause
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'workspace_members';
```

Expected: Policy should reference `get_user_workspace_ids` function (not self-referencing)

### 3. Check billing policies exist:
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('billing_customers', 'subscriptions')
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

Expected output:
```
billing_customers | Users can view their billing info    | SELECT
billing_customers | Users can create their billing info  | INSERT
billing_customers | Users can update their billing info  | UPDATE
subscriptions     | Users can view subscriptions...      | SELECT
subscriptions     | Users can insert subscriptions...    | INSERT
subscriptions     | Users can update subscriptions...    | UPDATE
```

### 4. Test the helper function:
```sql
-- Replace YOUR_USER_ID with your actual user_id from auth.users
SELECT get_user_workspace_ids('YOUR_USER_ID');
```

Expected: Should return your workspace ID(s) without errors

## üîê Security Note

The `SECURITY DEFINER` function is safe because:
- It only returns workspace IDs for the specified user
- It doesn't expose other users' data
- It's used solely to break the recursion cycle
- The RLS policy still validates workspace membership

This is a **common pattern** in PostgreSQL for handling RLS recursion issues.

## üìö Technical Background

### Why Did This Happen?

The original schema had a circular dependency:
1. `workspace_members` table has RLS enabled
2. Policy checks if user is member of workspace
3. To check membership, it queries `workspace_members`
4. This query triggers the same RLS policy again
5. PostgreSQL detects the infinite loop and blocks it

### Common Scenarios That Trigger This

This error typically appears when:
- Querying `workspace_members` from any authenticated context
- During checkout (needs workspace_id)
- Creating PRDs (validates workspace membership)
- Accessing library page (lists workspace PRDs)
- Any operation that checks workspace membership

### The PostgreSQL Error Code

- **Code**: `42P17`
- **Category**: Syntax Error or Access Rule Violation
- **Meaning**: Infinite recursion detected in RLS policy
- **PostgreSQL Docs**: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Still getting recursion error?

1. **Verify the fix was applied**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if helper function exists
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
   WHERE routine_name = 'get_user_workspace_ids';
   ```

2. **Check policy was updated**:
   ```sql
   -- Should NOT contain self-referencing subquery
   SELECT pg_get_expr(qual, 'workspace_members'::regclass)
   FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'workspace_members'
     AND policyname = 'Users can view members of their workspaces';
   ```

3. **Restart your app** (sometimes needed for connection pool refresh):
   ```bash
   # Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Other RLS errors?

- Check `BILLING_RLS_FIX.md` for missing INSERT/UPDATE policies
- Run `scripts/setup-supabase.sql` for complete schema reset
- Verify all RLS policies with the verification queries above

## üéØ Summary

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Infinite recursion** | `code: '42P17'` error | Helper function with `SECURITY DEFINER` |
| **Missing INSERT policies** | Silent insert failures | Added INSERT policies for billing tables |
| **Missing UPDATE policies** | Can't update subscriptions | Added UPDATE policies for billing tables |

All three issues are fixed by running `scripts/fix-rls-complete.sql`.

**After this fix, your billing integration will work end-to-end!** üéâ
